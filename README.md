# E-commerce Product Listing Page

This project is a responsive e-commerce product listing page built with Next.js. It features client-side search and filtering, a detailed product view modal, and an optional shopping cart. All product data is fetched from the Fake Store API.

## üöÄ Key Features

* **Product Display**: Products are shown in a responsive grid with images, names, prices, and descriptions. Data is fetched using **React Query** for efficient caching and state management.
* **Search & Filter**: Users can filter products by name using a client-side search and by category using filter buttons. The state for these features is managed globally with **Zustand**.
* **Product Details Modal**: Clicking on a product card opens a responsive modal that displays full product details, including a close button.
* **Mock "Add Product" Form**: A form is included to simulate adding a new product. It uses **React Hook Form** for handling and **Zod** for schema validation. Data is logged to the console instead of being sent to a backend.
* **Shopping Cart**: A floating cart icon shows the number of items added. Cart data is also managed by **Zustand**.
